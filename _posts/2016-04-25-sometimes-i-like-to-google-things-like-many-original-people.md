description: Sometimes I like to google things like “many original people towards an illegible face moronic alabaster consortium today or else” or “maybe flour can be policed by the astartiax simple fleet buster kettle or can it Fleur”. I think it would be so good if one of those searches got a really good result that I might never see with a basic search. So far I haven’t clicked on any results from the searches but next time I will definitely click one.

Sometimes I like to google things like "many original people towards an illegible face moronic alabaster consortium today or else" or "maybe flour can be policed by the astartiax simple fleet buster kettle or can it Fleur". I think it would be so good if one of those searches got a really good result that I might never see with a basic search. So far I haven't clicked on any results from the searches but next time I will definitely click one.

I would like to have a reason to do things on the internet as I am much better at things when I am purposeful, which is sort of like determination. It is good to feel determined to get a new search result and I feel that when I do click one my life will improve in terms of satisfaction.

I can sometimes know more about myself suddenly. This is a time of that. This time is about how when I do the next search I will be hovering over a link and then I will think about how I am improving in satisfaction just from doing the search, and why be greedy. It will be a lily-livered excuse for not carpe dieming but I will understand. I will be ok with that. I will close the laptop and accept myself. I will say, You've already done so much today by waking up and eating breakfast, clicking a result would be frills. You deserve to use a small but potentially significant part of the Earth's remaining resources to be happy, I will say.
