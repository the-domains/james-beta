Being grouchy can be very fun.

Sometimes when someone is grouchy to me I like to be grouchy back to them. It makes me feel satisfied and justified.

When I am grouchy it usually gives me a good feeling of achievement.

Sometimes after I am grouchy I feel a bit bad because unfortunately I say to myself things like that I know better and that of course I would prefer it if everyone felt all nice instead of just me.

The problem with being grouchy is that after I grouch usually it is just me who is feeling good and other people who are feeling bad. In fact often the reason why I am grouchy in the first place is to feel good after feeling bad because someone else was grouchy.

I have come up with a solution because I thought about it. I think it would be great if we made society be about that everyone was grouchy to each other all the time, so that everyone could feel good by grouching quickly if they felt bad because of someone else's grouch. If it was a rule then people would be relieved by not having to think non-useful thoughts about knowing better.

People could be grouchy about having been given the wrong sandwich and about someone not washing their plate in the sink. They could be grouchy about the sun being the wrong sort of hot today, about their car not being fast enough because of all the other cars, about the streetlights being too bright and about their train ticket being too pointy. I think that last one would be an especially lovely one as train tickets really are very pointy.

Imagine this idea, if it was real! People being grouchy everywhere they went, about all kinds of things, back and forth to each other. People being grouchy instead of saying hi or please pass the apple slices. When they had been grouchy about big things for a while, people would get a bit bored and would start being grouchy about smaller things instead. Everyone would be able to be so happy.

You walked too close to me, they would say. You shook my hand for too long. You looked at me in a weird way. You opened the door for me. You didn't open the door for me. You seemed too proud. You seemed not proud enough. Your eyes got squinty suddenly. You smiled at the wrong time. You talked to me using the wrong words. You said a nice thing at the wrong time. You laughed for too long about the wrong thing. You said I am beautiful. You said the world is beautiful when I think it is not. Your pants are too normal-coloured.

We could all feel so good quickly! It would be everyone being grouchy about everything other people did, all the time. Wow, great!

Sometimes I have seen grouchy people yelling at each other with no filter. I have seen this on trains and also on train stations. Perhaps trains make people especially grouchy, which is important information. These very grouchy train people are quite a good example because they often seem sort of happy too. It is probably because they feel proud about teaching other people on the train how to be more grouchy and happy about being it. I think that is good.
